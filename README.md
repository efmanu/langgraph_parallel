Building Parallel Workflows with LangGraph: A Practical Guide
Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools for natural language processing, but orchestrating complex workflows with them can be challenging. This is where LangGraph enters the picture - a specialized framework designed to bring structure and efficiency to LLM applications.
LangGraph stands out by treating your LLM application as a directed graph, where each node represents a specific operation and edges define the flow of data. What makes it particularly powerful is its ability to handle parallel processing, allowing multiple operations to execute simultaneously when they don't depend on each other's outputs.
In this guide, we'll explore a practical example: building a topic-based summary generator. Imagine you want to generate comprehensive summaries about a topic, but instead of a linear approach, you want to explore multiple angles simultaneously. Our application will take a topic (like "birds"), generate several subtopics in parallel, create summaries for each, and then select the best one - all while maintaining clean state management and type safety.
This real-world use case demonstrates how LangGraph's parallel processing capabilities can significantly improve efficiency and create more sophisticated LLM applications. Let's dive into how we can build this system step by step.
Understanding the Building Blocks
LangGraph's power lies in its core components that work together to create structured LLM applications. At its heart is the StateGraph, which serves as the main container for your application's logic. Each operation in your workflow is represented by a Node, which can process data independently and in parallel when possible.
The flow of data between nodes is managed through TypedDict-based states, ensuring type safety and clear data contracts. These states can be annotated with operators like operator.add to handle parallel processing results. Edges connect these nodes, defining both sequential and conditional paths through your application.
This structured approach allows us to build complex, parallel workflows while maintaining clarity and reliability in our LLM applications.
State Management
LangGraph uses TypedDict to define structured state, ensuring clarity and type safety. Annotations, particularly Annotated[list, operator.add], play a crucial role in merging multiple outputs into a single list, enabling efficient parallel processing. Best practices for state design include:
Keeping state definitions minimal yet expressive
Using clear type annotations for maintainability
Ensuring immutability where feasible
Structuring state logically to support parallelism and conditional flows

Core Components
Nodes and Edge Design
In LangGraph, nodes are the fundamental processing units that follow the single-responsibility principle. Each node has a clear, specific task - whether it's generating topics, creating summaries, or selecting the best content.
State Management
State transitions are handled through TypedDict classes that define clear contracts for data flow. The OverallState maintains the global context, while SummaryState manages data for individual parallel operations.
Parallel Flow Configuration
Edges define how data flows between nodes. Using add_conditional_edges, we can create parallel processing paths. For example:
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "generate_topics", 
    continue_to_summaries, 
    ["generate_summary"]
)
This setup allows multiple summary generations to run concurrently, improving efficiency.
Example Implementation: LangGraph Parallel Workflow Processing
Our implementation demonstrates parallel processing by building a topic summarization system that:
Takes a topic like "birds"
Generates multiple subtopics (e.g., "migration patterns", "nesting habits", "feeding behaviors")
Creates summaries for each subtopic simultaneously
Refines and selects the best summary

The parallel approach allows us to process multiple summaries concurrently, significantly reducing overall execution time compared to sequential processing.
1. Setting Up the Environment
To build our parallel processing application, we'll need to set up our environment with key dependencies:
pip install langgraph langchain-deepseek pydantic typing-extensions
We configure DeepSeek as our LLM with specific parameters:
model = ChatDeepSeek(
    model="deepseek-chat",
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=1000,
    timeout=None,
    max_retries=2
)
This setup provides the foundation for our parallel processing workflow, ensuring reliable and consistent responses from our LLM.
2. Defining the Data Models
LangGraph applications require well-structured data models to ensure reliable processing and type safety. Our implementation uses three key components:
2.1 Pydantic Models for Structured Output
class Subjects(BaseModel):
    subjects: list[str]

class Summary(BaseModel):
    summary: str

class BestSummary(BaseModel):
    id: int = Field(description="Index of the best summary, starting with 0", ge=0)
These Pydantic models ensure that LLM outputs are properly structured and validated. They act as contracts between the LLM and our application, preventing unexpected data formats.
2.2 State Definitions
class OverallState(TypedDict):
  topic: str
  subjects: list
  summaries: Annotated[list, operator.add]
  best_selected_summary: str

class SummaryState(TypedDict):
    subject: str
    summary: Annotated[list, operator.add]
The state definitions serve two crucial purposes:
- Managing the overall workflow state (`OverallState`)
- Handling individual parallel processing states (`TopicState`)
2.3 Type Safety Considerations
- Use of TypedDict ensures compile-time type checking
- Annotated with operator.add enables proper merging of parallel outputs
- Field descriptions and validators (like ge=0) prevent invalid data
- Clear separation between global and node-specific states prevents state pollution
This robust type system helps catch errors early and makes the codebase more maintainable and self-documenting.
This section explains the core data modeling aspects of your LangGraph application, emphasizing type safety and state management through Pydantic and TypedDict classes. It shows how proper data modeling supports parallel processing while maintaining code reliability.
3. Building Processing Nodes
In our LangGraph application, nodes are the fundamental processing units. Each node has a specific responsibility and can be executed independently or in parallel when possible.
3.1 Topic Generation Node
This node takes the initial topic and generates multiple related subjects for exploration.

def generate_topics(state: OverallState) -> OverallState:
  prompt = topics_prompt.format(topic=state["topic"])
  response = model.with_structured_output(Topics).invoke(prompt)
  return {
    "topics": response.topics,
    "subjects": response.topics
  }
Key Features:
- Uses a formatted prompt to generate related topics
- Returns both topics and subjects for parallel processing
- Structured output ensures consistent data format
3.2 Parallel Topic Generation Node
This node processes individual subjects in parallel to generate detailed topics.
def generate_topic(state: TopicState) -> TopicState:
  prompt = topic_prompt.format(subject=state["subject"])
  response = model.with_structured_output(Topic).invoke(prompt)
  return {"generated_topic": [response.topic]}
Key Features:
- Processes a single subject independently
- Can be executed in parallel for multiple subjects
- Returns structured output for consistency
3.3 Topic Refinement Node
This node takes generated topics and refines them to be more interesting and detailed.
def refine_topic(state: TopicState) -> TopicState:
  prompt = refine_topic_prompt.format(topic=state["generated_topic"][0])
  response = model.with_structured_output(Topic).invoke(prompt)
  return {"generated_topic": [response.topic]}
Key Features:
- Improves the quality of generated topics
- Maintains consistent state structure
- Processes refined content independently
3.4 Best Topic Selection Node
This node evaluates all refined topics and selects the most suitable one.
